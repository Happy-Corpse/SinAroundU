        Nowadays, more and more people are attracted by education resources and job opportunities in Singapore,
        and therefore plan for a long-term stay here. But for newcomers who want to settle down in Singapore, 
        finding an accommodation is a major concern, because it can influence every aspect of our daily life 
        and there are so many factors to take into account. For example, parents will care about schools nearby 
        their apartment, and single people may look for apartments close to a hawker center.<br>
        However, the information about schools, hawker centers, parks, car parks, and available houses are usually offered by 
        different local websites or online forums. Hence, itâ€™s hard  and time-consuming for newcomers to collect thorough information.
        Our goal is to offer newcomers thorough information about schools, hawker centers, 
        available properties within a neighborhood, so as to help users make a wise decision on which apartment to rent or buy.
